AWS Scripts & Templates
=======================

A basic repository containing various useful CLI scripts and CloudFormation
templates I've written and/or used previously. Some of these are used
by my Jenkins servers to launch, update, and maintain various peices of my
infrastructure. CLI code is needed to bridge the gap for peices that the
CloudFormation API misses. Alternative suggestions welcome!

### AWS Scripts
